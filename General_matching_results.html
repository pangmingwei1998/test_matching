1.1 Policy and Procedures

Supplier shall have a written policy on freedom of association. In addition, Supplier shall have procedures and systems to implement its freedom of association policy in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Applicable Laws and Regulations, Apple’s Supplier Code of Conduct, and Supplier Responsibility Standards.

Supplier shall respect Workers’ lawful rights to form or participate (or refrain from forming or participating) in organizations of their choosing, including but not limited to unions, Worker committees, or other Worker associations, and bargain collectively without interference, discrimination, retaliation, or harassment. Supplier shall accommodate Workers should they express a desire for a Grievance mechanism in addition to formal representation.

Where Applicable Laws and Regulations substantially restrict freedom of association, Supplier shall allow alternative means for Workers to individually and collectively engage with Supplier, including processes for Workers to express their Grievances and protect their rights regarding working conditions and terms of employment. Where such alternative means are provided, they should be accessible by all workers, regardless of race, religion, gender or nationality, or other protected class.

1.2 Neutrality

Supplier is not required to take an active role in supporting Workers’ efforts to associate or organize, but they must ensure that Workers can exercise their rights in a climate free of violence, pressure, fear, intimidation, and threats.

1.3 Deductions

Supplier shall not deduct union membership fees or any other union fees from Workers’ wages without the express and written consent of individual Workers, unless specified otherwise in freely negotiated and valid collective bargaining agreements.</td>
