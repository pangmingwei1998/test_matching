Where possible, this review should take place prior to the start of manufacturing. This review shall be based upon the previously mentioned combustibility testing data and all storage, processing and waste management risks encountered in the workplace/facility related to combustible dust producing processes and equipment.\n\nA DHA shall be facilitated by a qualified person or third-party for any confirmed combustible dust. Other participants in the review from related facility departments should include Maintenance, Engineering, Operations and Environment and Health and Safety (EHS).",

A list of controls mentioned below should be implement based on the process and the risk levels as applicable. Controls listed are not the only control a facility may need to implement. Additional controls may be required to fully mitigate risks arising from combustible dust operations.\n\n3.1 Electrical Hazard Area Classification (HAC)\n\nFacilities where Combustible Dust is being produced or is otherwise present shall be subject to a Hazardous Area Classification analysis. NFPA 499, GB 12476.1, and GB 12476.2 or equivalent should be followed for guidance in conducting the analysis.\n\nThe Hazardous Area Classification analysis shall be performed by qualified persons who have demonstrated competency in the area of conducting these analyses.\n\n3.2 Collection of Combustible Dust\n\nMachines that produce fine particles of combustible material shall be provided with hoods, capture devices, or enclosures that are connected to a dust collection system having suction and capture velocity to collect and transport all the dust produced.\n\nEnclosureless dust collectors are prohibited for collection of metal dust.\n\nFor dust collectors equipped with fan/blowers and where metal is used for construction of fan blades or housings, the metal shall be a non-sparking such as bronze, nonmagnetic stainless steel or aluminum.\n\nDry dust collectors shall not be used for collection of aluminum, magnesium, niobium, tantalum, titanium, zirconium or hafnium dusts.\n\nTransport velocities inside the ductwork shall be sufficient to ensure the transport of both coarse and fine particles and to ensure re-entrainment if, for any reason, the particles fall out before delivery to the collector. For metal dusts, a minimum transport velocity of 23 m/sec is required. For non-metal dusts a minimum transport velocity of 20 m/sec is required.\n\n3.3 Combustible Dust Control via Housekeeping\n\nA housekeeping plan shall be developed and maintained for any areas presenting a Combustible Dust hazard. The plan shall include appropriate methods and processes for performing the cleaning.\n\nRegular cleaning frequencies shall be established for walls, floors, and horizontal surfaces, such as equipment, ducts, pipes, hoods, ledges, beams, and above suspended ceilings and other concealed surfaces, to minimize accumulations of dust that present a Combustible Dust hazard within the facility.\n\nIn areas where metal dust is being produced, or otherwise handled, dust shall not be allowed to accumulate to a level that obscures the color of the surface beneath it.\n\nSurfaces shall be cleaned in a manner that minimizes the generation of dust clouds. Vigorous sweeping, brushing, or blowing dust with compressed air produces dust clouds and shall not be permitted.\n\n3.4 Control of ignition sources\n\nFacilities with combustible dust hazards must have robust controls to eliminate ignition sources. Such facilities should have:\n\n• Hot work permit program\n• A no-smoking policy\n• Permanently installed process equipment including ventilation and dust collection systems. All building structural steel shall be grounded and bonded to prevent static electricity build up. Grounding and bonding should be periodically checked to ensure continuity.\n• All machinery shall be installed and maintained in a manner that minimizes the possibility of friction sparks. Hot surfaces should be maintained below the Minimum Ignition Temperature (MIT) of a dust layer ASTM E2021, of combustible dust.\n\n3.5 Process improvements\n\nFacilities can implement, where applicable and technically feasible, processes such as:\n\n• Dust capture water curtains • Wet polishing/machining • Extraction ventilation\n\n3.6 Performance Based Option\n\nAs an alternative, where and when necessary, a qualified person(s) may develop performance-based design provisions with regards to management of Combustible Dust fire and explosion hazards, in lieu of the prescriptive requirements outlined in this standard.\n\n• The performance-based design must demonstrate that the approach provides at least an equivalent measure of safety with regard to prescriptive requirements • The performance-based design should be documented with all calculations, references, assumptions, and sources from which material characteristics and other data have been obtained or on which the designer has relied for some material aspect of the design",

A due diligence management system shall include:\n\n• Risk identification\n• Risk prevention and mitigation\n• Third Party verifications or audits of Supply Chain due diligence\n• A mechanism for reporting applicable risks\n\n1.2 Supplier Policy Requirements\n\nSuppliers shall have a due diligence policy that is consistent with OECD Guidance and/or the OECD-FAO Guidance (as applicable), and this Standard. The policy shall also require Processors in the Supplier’s Supply Chain to have corresponding\n\ndue diligence policies down to the level of the Source or Origin, which includes the level of Mining Companies, farms, collection points of Recyclable Waste, or the original source of primary ore at the mining level.\n\nSuppliers shall ensure that their facilities and suppliers comply with the obligations and requirements of this Standard.\n\n1.3 Supplier Policy Distribution\n\nFor Relevant Minerals, Suppliers shall distribute their policies to:\n\n• All subcontractors and suppliers that produce Goods for use in Apple’s products • Supplier procurement personnel and factory management\n\nFor Relevant Materials, Suppliers shall distribute their policies to Apple. As appropriate, Apple may require a Supplier to distribute their policies further.\n\n1.4 Use of Relevant Minerals and Relevant Materials\n\nSuppliers shall not use Relevant Minerals or Relevant Materials in any Goods produced for use in Apple’s products if a Supplier cannot reasonably demonstrate that it has a due diligence management system and has performed the required due diligence activities, as outlined below.\n\nTo the extent that a Supplier seeks only to implement a due diligence management system and perform required due diligence activities with respect to specific Apple-related supply lines, Apple may require, as appropriate, such Supplier to (i) demonstrate to Apple a reasonably comprehensive system to segregate Relevant Minerals or Relevant Materials for use in Apple’s products from Relevant Materials or Relevant Materials used in other parties’ products and (ii) undergo a Third Party verification or audit of such a segregation system.\n\nIn addition to the requirements pertaining to Relevant Materials, the following use\n\nrestrictions apply to the use of leather in Goods:\n\n• Only domesticated bovines (limited to cow, steer, bull, calf, or oxen) raised for food production may be used.

Many of the foregoing are also identified in OECD Annex II\n\n- Embargoed countries or High Risk Entities risks: Sourcing from embargoed countries (as described in the High Risk Regions list defined in this Standard) or from High Risk Entities\n\n• Other High Risks – at the mining, farm, transport, trading, or Processor level of the Supply Chain:\n\n- Health and safety violations, including both community and workers\n- Environmental impacts, including water abstraction and consumption, waste, pollution and tailings management, deforestation such as illegal logging, and encroachment on protected areas\n- Animal welfare impacts, such as the inhumane treatment of animals.\nIndigenous peoples’ and affected communities’ rights impacts, including lack of free, prior, and informed consent, potential resettlement and encroachment on cultural heritage sites\n- Retaliatory threats, intimidation, or attacks against human rights and environmental defenders\n\nThese and any other applicable risks may be identified through activities of section 2.1 and 2.2.\n\n2.1 Supply Chain Mapping\n\nSuppliers shall map their Supply Chains for Relevant Minerals and Relevant Materials.
