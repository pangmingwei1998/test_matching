    "Preamble": "The following notes apply to all provisions herein:\n\n14.1.1 When there is a discrepancy between the RBA code, local law, a participant’s policies, or a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), the RBA defines conformance to the RBA code as meeting the strictest requirements (even if it meets RBA code provisions and legal requirements). A Collective Bargaining Agreement may create requirements beyond the RBA Code requirements. The Validated assessment (VA) shall not validate CBA compliance where it is stricter than the RBA Code.\n\n14.1.2 A legal non-conformance is a Major non-conformance unless otherwise stated in a specific provision (e.g., A3.1 if the situation of reviewee is below 60h/w but above local law for ≤40% of the workers) or there is another finding which has a higher non-conformance rating for that provision.\n\n14.1.3 All communications from the reviewee to workers shall be done in a language the worker can understand unless otherwise stated in the provisions. If this is not the case, the relevant aspect is, at minimum, a ‘Major’ non-conformance.\n\n14.1.4 Guidance applies to all workers, including temporary, migrant, student, and contract, directly and indirectly, employed workers that work in the factory/on production/in the warehouse and any other type of worker/employee unless the AC specifically states a narrower focus group.\n\n14.1.5 Unless otherwise noted, references to the percentage of workers in conformance or nonconformance are based on the defined sample.\n\n14.1.6 A Process is not required to be in writing (unless the AC states specifically it shall be documented). However, all processes shall be verifiably implemented consistently.\n\n14.1.7 Adequate shall mean appropriate and complete for its intended purpose. In practice, it means all required code compliance elements are included in the document (policy or procedure). For example, n adequate policy on prohibition of child labor includes all the elements RBA requires on this code topic.\n\n14.1.8 Effective shall mean successfully achieves its intended goal or outcome. In practice, this means all implementation elements are deployed and the outcome of process/procedure meets the RBA requirement. An effective procedure of child labor will include all RBA required implementation elements such as age verification, personnel files and no children are present or have been hired.\n\nInternal Migrant Workers\n\n14.1.9 Internal migrant workers: Individuals who are recruited and migrate from their usual place of residence to another state or province within their home country for employment purposes. These individuals may differ from the dominant group, often the majority population—in terms of race, color, religion, or cultural origin.\n\n14.1.10 Internal migrant workers shall be considered a separate group, like foreign migrant workers, during the Validated assessment to determine risks and conformance specific to this group.\n\nCode 8.0 Labor Preamble: Participants commit to respect the human rights of workers, and to treat them with dignity and respect as understood by the international community. This applies to all workers including temporary, migrant, student, contract, direct employees, and any other type of worker.",

    "Preamble": "Code 8.0: Forced labor in any form, including but not limited to, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary or exploitative prison labor, slavery or trafficking of persons is not permitted. This includes transporting, harboring, recruiting, transferring, or receiving persons by means of threat, force, coercion, abduction or fraud for labor or services. There shall be no unreasonable restrictions on workers’ freedom of movement in the facility in addition to unreasonable restrictions on entering or exiting company- provided facilities including, if applicable, workers’ dormitories or living quarters. As part of the hiring process, all workers must be provided with a written employment agreement in their native language, or in a language the worker can understand that contains a description of terms and conditions of employment. Foreign migrant workers must receive the employment agreement prior to the worker departing from his or her country of origin and there shall be no substitution or change(s) allowed in the employment agreement upon arrival in the receiving country unless these changes are made to meet local law and provide equal or better terms. All work shall be voluntary, and workers shall be free to leave work at any time or terminate their employment without penalty if reasonable notice is given, which shall be clearly stated in workers’ contracts. Participants shall maintain documentation on all leaving workers. Employers, agents, and sub-agents’ may not hold or otherwise destroy, conceal, or confiscate identity or immigration documents, such as government-issued identification, passports, or work permits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, employers can only hold documentation if necessary to comply with the local law. In this case, at no time shall workers be denied access to their documents. Workers shall not be required to pay employers’ agents or sub-agents’ recruitment fees or other related fees for their employment. If any such fees are found to have been paid by workers, such fees shall be repaid to the worker.\n\nElements to Demonstrate Compliance to RBA Code:",
