### VAP Standard

The following notes apply to all provisions herein:

14.1.1 When there is a discrepancy between the RBA code, local law, a participant’s policies, or a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), the RBA defines conformance to the RBA code as meeting the strictest requirements (even if it meets RBA code provisions and legal requirements). A Collective Bargaining Agreement may create requirements beyond the RBA Code requirements. The Validated assessment (VA) shall not validate CBA compliance where it is stricter than the RBA Code.

14.1.2 A legal non-conformance is a Major non-conformance unless otherwise stated in a specific provision (e.g., A3.1 if the situation of reviewee is below 60h/w but above local law for ≤40% of the workers) or there is another finding which has a higher non-conformance rating for that provision.

14.1.3 All communications from the reviewee to workers shall be done in a language the worker can understand unless otherwise stated in the provisions. If this is not the case, the relevant aspect is, at minimum, a ‘Major’ non-conformance.

14.1.4 Guidance applies to all workers, including temporary, migrant, student, and contract, directly and indirectly, employed workers that work in the factory/on production/in the warehouse and any other type of worker/employee unless the AC specifically states a narrower focus group.

14.1.5 Unless otherwise noted, references to the percentage of workers in conformance or nonconformance are based on the defined sample.

14.1.6 A Process is not required to be in writing (unless the AC states specifically it shall be documented). However, all processes shall be verifiably implemented consistently.

14.1.7 Adequate shall mean appropriate and complete for its intended purpose. In practice, it means all required code compliance elements are included in the document (policy or procedure). For example, n adequate policy on prohibition of child labor includes all the elements RBA requires on this code topic.

14.1.8 Effective shall mean successfully achieves its intended goal or outcome. In practice, this means all implementation elements are deployed and the outcome of process/procedure meets the RBA requirement. An effective procedure of child labor will include all RBA required implementation elements such as age verification, personnel files and no children are present or have been hired.

Internal Migrant Workers

14.1.9 Internal migrant workers: Individuals who are recruited and migrate from their usual place of residence to another state or province within their home country for employment purposes. These individuals may differ from the dominant group, often the majority population—in terms of race, color, religion, or cultural origin.

14.1.10 Internal migrant workers shall be considered a separate group, like foreign migrant workers, during the Validated assessment to determine risks and conformance specific to this group.

Code 8.0 Labor Preamble: Participants commit to respect the human rights of workers, and to treat them with dignity and respect as understood by the international community. This applies to all workers including temporary, migrant, student, contract, direct employees, and any other type of worker.

Code 8.0 Labor Preamble: Participants commit to respect the human rights of workers, and to treat them with dignity and respect as understood by the international community. This applies to all workers including temporary, migrant, student, contract, direct employees, and any other type of worker.

# A1. Prohibition of Forced Labor

Code 8.0: Forced labor in any form, including but not limited to, bonded (including debt bondage) or indentured labor, involuntary or exploitative prison labor, slavery or trafficking of persons is not permitted.

There shall be no unreasonable restrictions on workers’ freedom of movement in the facility in addition to unreasonable restrictions on entering or exiting company- provided facilities including, if applicable, workers’ dormitories or living quarters. As part of the hiring process, all workers must be provided with a written employment agreement in their native language, or in a language the worker can understand that contains a description of terms and conditions of employment. Foreign migrant workers must receive the employment agreement prior to the worker departing from his or her country of origin and there shall be no substitution or change(s) allowed in the employment agreement upon arrival in the receiving country unless these changes are made to meet local law and provide equal or better terms. All work shall be voluntary, and workers shall be free to leave work at any time or terminate their employment without penalty if reasonable notice is given, which shall be clearly stated in workers’ contracts. Participants shall maintain documentation on all leaving workers. Employers, agents, and sub-agents’ may not hold or otherwise destroy, conceal, or confiscate identity or immigration documents, such as government-issued identification, passports, or work permits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, employers can only hold documentation if necessary to comply with the local law. In this case, at no time shall workers be denied access to their documents. Workers shall not be required to pay employers’ agents or sub-agents’ recruitment fees or other related fees for their employment. If any such fees are found to have been paid by workers, such fees shall be repaid to the worker.

Foreign and internal migrant workers should be interviewed when they join the company to learn if any of the policies were violated, in which case remedy must be provided, and they must be informed of the grievance mechanism. If fees and costs were found to be charged, workers must be repaid within 90 days.

7. Fees evaluation criteria:

3.Due Diligence: verify that worker is actively enrolled in a valid program of study at an educational institution.

Note: If learners are NOTto be hired alearner policyis not needed,however a note stating that the supplier does not hire apprentices/interns/student workers is required to be in place.

2. Procedures & Practices are in place such that:

a. You only employ workers above the legal/hiring policy age for employment.   
b. There is a formal documented process to verify the age of each worker prior to employment with procedures to ensure that workers are of legal age and that documentation is genuine. The process includes inspection and cross-reference to verify the validity of at least two types of official ID\* and periodically evaluating the documentation for a random sample of workers.   
c. ID types for initial and ongoing verification and cross-reference include. i. Matching photographic ID to worker’s face ii.

e. If young workers found to be working in prohibited times or in hazardous roles, immediate containment not termination is to occur putting on day shift only which does not conflict with compulsory education, moved to non-hazardous positions, elimination of future overtime.   
f. A documented process is in place to assist any underage workers found working in the facility. This does not include discharging or fining underage workers, but rather provides ways to move them into proper apprenticeship positions, restricts their work hours and type of work as well as accommodating their educational needs (see Policy section above).   
g. Ensure that any children present in the facility are allowed only in approved areas, separate from the work area, such as day care facilities.   
h. If apprentices are employed, there is a clear program for training and promotion, with specific limits on the number of hours worked, duration of training period, and number of times the same worker can be classified as a trainee.

3. Controls & Monitoring should include:

a. Applicable laws and regulations ensuring protection of learners’ rights (e.g., working conditions, health & safety) are identified and enforced.   
b. Perform due diligence on, monitor and take corrective actions to address any non-conformance by an involved educational institution and establish sanctions as appropriate, including termination of the relationship.   
c. Periodically verify the reliability of age records. Age verification shall include visual verification of a government recognized photographic identification record. Maintain a reliable ID verification system to control the workers' access into the facility.

# A3. Working Hours

Code 8.0: Working hours shall not exceed the maximum set by local law. Further, a work week shall not be more than 60 hours per week, including overtime, except in emergency or unusual situations. All overtime shall be voluntary. Workers shall be allowed to have at least one day off every seven days.

Elements to Demonstrate Compliance to RBA Code:

1. Policy: Have a detailed, comprehensive documented working hour policy with elements including:

a. Standard hours worked, days off, sick leave allowance, holidays, leave/vacation allowance, and paternity/maternity leave, in conformance to local law.   
b. Meal and rest breaks, overtime policy and limits; in conformance to local law and good safety practices. These shall include gender-responsive measures and other accommodations.   
c. Note limits on i. Working hours in the facilities designated standard workweek (e.g. Sunday to Saturday, Monday to Sunday): must not be more than 60 including overtime. ii. Consecutive working days after which a day of rest is granted with no company work or obligations (e.g., training, being on call): must not be more than 6 iii. Overtime.

NOTE: Unless specified otherwise by local legal requirements, this provision does not apply to exempt workers, including those in executive, managerial, or professional positions.

2. Procedures & Practices are in place such that:

a. The work hours and time off policy is communicated to workers at the time of hire and in an employee handbook.   
b. There is a process to remain aware of and in compliance with local and national laws and regulations regarding working hours.   
c. You have obtained any necessary permission from authorities/unions on work schedule (e.g., comprehensive work week / work hour schedule)   
d. RBA Code requires that companies comply with local laws or Code, whichever is more stringent. If the company has a valid and current government waiver (e.g., Comprehensive Work Hour System in China, which allows shifting of overtime limits), this waiver is considered “local law.” Regardless of the waiver, the 60 hours/week limit is in place.   
e. Any legal non-conformance is rated a major non-conformance. An exception to this rule is whether weekly working hours are below or equal to 60h/week but above local law for less than 40% of the reviewed working hours.   
f. There is a process to track and analyze hours over time, including identification of capacity constraints, and is taking action to reduce overtime to target level.   
g. You have a work hours management system to ensure that workers do not work overtime in excess of legal limits. Work weeks do not exceed than 60 hours, including overtime, except in Emergency or Unusual Situations.

NOTE: The RBA recognizes truly unpredictable events that may require overtime in excess of RBA limits. These are Emergency or Unusual Situations which cannot be planned for orforeseen. Such situations are uncommon and do not become standard operating procedure. Examples include:

i. Equipment breakdown, power failure or other emergency resulting in prolonged shutdown of a production line.

ii. Unforeseen raw material or component shortages or quality issues shut down production. Excessive overtime is then needed in both situations to recoup lost production time and meet customer commitments.   
iii. In all of these cases evidence of FEWER hours worked before a period of excessive production due to an Emergency or Unusual Situation is present and documented. The site has a documented plan to recover from the emergency situation and bring working hours back into conformance.

NOTE: the types of situations are NOT Emergency or Unusual Situations include:

iv. Holidays, peak season production demands and new product ramps. These are predictable and proper planning can minimize overtime requirements.   
v. Contract change orders that significantly increase order volumes or shorten delivery timelines. This should be negotiated in good faith between the client and the location and should never exceed the capacity of the location at a rate of 60 hours per week or the legal maximum work hour requirement for the location.

h. Workers may refuse overtime without threat of retaliation, penalty, or dismissal.

i. The facility provides meal breaks, rest breaks, rest days, leave periods, holidays, and vacation days per local legal requirements (most countries require workers to be given a 15-to-30-minute break every so many hours, as well as defined meal breaks).   
j. Legal working hours are communicated to workers (worker handbook, notice board, orientation training, and other means).   
k. Workers are not required to work on their designated day off.

3. Controls & Monitoring should include:

a. Ensure there is a strong tracking and recording system which will allow for accurate reporting, record keeping allowing for investigation, and visibility to those planning workload to avoid going over limits if not actively limit planning work beyond work hour and workday limits.   
b. Ensure awareness of requirements of compliance with local and national/regional laws and regulations including any approved comprehensive work week / work hour schedule, RBA requirements and any customer requirements regarding working hours, workdays, and overtime   
c. Develop and implement a planning, training, staffing and work assignment strategy to ensure conformance with all requirements.   
d. Train and then refresh train planning and manufacturing staff on limits of working hours and days worked including the limits of any Young Workers and Learners present.   
e. Monitor actual performance and actively adjust and control working hours including overtime and days worked to ensure conformance to policy.   
f. Supplier monitors hours for any workers of on-site supplier / subcontractor / agent to ensure the meet the stricter of local law, RBA Code of Conduct, customer requirements, or company policy.

4. Records are maintained including:

a. Accurately determine and record days, time and overtime worked to ensure conformance and the provide accurate due monetary compensation.   
b. Exceptional circumstances shall be recorded at the time of the Emergency or Unusual Situation along with the plan to recover. Not after the event.   
c. Leave records are securely kept, accurate and consistent with medical certificates, actual leave (including maternity/paternity) and holidays.

5. Serious conditions that will result in a severe finding:
