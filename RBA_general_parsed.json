    "content": "Elements to Demonstrate Compliance to RBA Code:\n\n1. Policy: Have a detailed, comprehensive documented young worker policy with elements including:\n\na. Child labor prohibition: setting a minimum working age that is no lower than the greater of local law, 15 years of age, or customer expectations.\nb. Do not refuse a previous applicant if they now meet company policy and the corresponding legal requirements.\nc. If underage labor is identified, assistance/remediation is provided and should include: i. Health exam and appropriate action if necessary. ii. Aid to and through completion of compulsory schooling. iii. Maintaining the child's income until legally eligible to work. iv. When they exist, and are acceptable by law, to move underage workers into proper apprenticeship positions, restricting their hours and type of work to accommodate educational needs, as required, rather than discharging or fining these workers.\n\nd. When young workers are employed, policies shall include:\n\ni. Health checks if required by law. ii. Identification and assignment of young workers to non-hazardous positions. iii. Restriction on time of day worked (young workers are not allowed night work <generally means any consecutive period of at least 7 hours between 10 PM and 7 AM> or overtime).\n\ne. When employing learners (apprentices, interns, student workers) a policy shall include:\n\ni. A commitment to only providing internships/student workers assignments and apprenticeships that complement their course of study field or learning of a new vocation.\nii. Follow a principle of equal pay for equal work (if performing same/similar work/level as regular workers then the pay should be the same).\niii. Ensure working hours shall not conflict with any of the learner’s school attendance.\niv. Be clear and limit the duration of the training period, and the number of times the same worker can be classified as a trainee.\nv. Do not require and ensure that there is not any placement, onboarding, or other fees paid by the learner to gain or retain employment.\nvi. Do not allow deduction for educational fees from the student worker’s wages.\nvii. If there is a period where wages can be below minimum wage as per law it should be limited and reasonable in duration or not longer than 6 months, whichever is stricter.\nviii. Ensure that no agency or intermediary is used in connection with the recruitment, hiring, arrangement, and management of student workers, interns, or apprentices.\n\nix. Ensure that all work is voluntary (including choice of learning placement assignment).\n\nx. Do not use student workers, interns, or apprentices to simply fill a labor shortage.\n\nxi. When employing apprentices, the maximum duration of apprenticeship (not more than 6 months if worker is paid below minimum wage).\n\nxii. When employing Student workers policy shall include:\n\n1. A three-way agreement is required between the student workers (and/or legal guardian), school and supplier that includes the terms.\n2. Ensure that the student worker is insured against accidents or liability and that the student worker is fully covered for any other forms of insurance required by law or regulation.\n3. Due Diligence: verify that worker is actively enrolled in a valid program of study at an educational institution.\n\nNote: If learners are NOTto be hired alearner policyis not needed,however a note stating that the supplier does not hire apprentices/interns/student workers is required to be in place.\n\n2. Procedures & Practices are in place such that:\n\na. You only employ workers above the legal/hiring policy age for employment.\nb. There is a formal documented process to verify the age of each worker prior to employment with procedures to ensure that workers are of legal age and that documentation is genuine. The process includes inspection and cross-reference to verify the validity of at least two types of official ID\\* and periodically evaluating the documentation for a random sample of workers.\nc. ID types for initial and ongoing verification and cross-reference include. i. Matching photographic ID to worker’s face ii. Verification through third-party resources where available, such as Internet resources or local government offices iii. Affidavit from local government representative iv. Birth certificate v. Government-issued personal identification card vi. Driver’s license vii. Voting registration card viii. “Official stamped” copy of a school certificate ix. Foreign or internal work permit or other government recognized record. x. Finger printing or ID card with owner's photograph to prevent under-age workers entering the facility by using another person's ID who may have been vetted or hired.\nd. Ensure that young workers are working within the appropriate conditions of employment: including legal working hours, not working overtime, not working nights, not working within school hours, and not working in hazardous conditions or roles.\ne. If young workers found to be working in prohibited times or in hazardous roles, immediate containment not termination is to occur putting on day shift only which does not conflict with compulsory education, moved to non-hazardous positions, elimination of future overtime.\nf. A documented process is in place to assist any underage workers found working in the facility. This does not include discharging or fining underage workers, but rather provides ways to move them into proper apprenticeship positions, restricts their work hours and type of work as well as accommodating their educational needs (see Policy section above).\ng. Ensure that any children present in the facility are allowed only in approved areas, separate from the work area, such as day care facilities.\nh. If apprentices are employed, there is a clear program for training and promotion, with specific limits on the number of hours worked, duration of training period, and number of times the same worker can be classified as a trainee.\n\n3. Controls & Monitoring should include:\n\na. Applicable laws and regulations ensuring protection of learners’ rights (e.g., working conditions, health & safety) are identified and enforced.\nb. Perform due diligence on, monitor and take corrective actions to address any non-conformance by an involved educational institution and establish sanctions as appropriate, including termination of the relationship.\nc. Periodically verify the reliability of age records. Age verification shall include visual verification of a government recognized photographic identification record. Maintain a reliable ID verification system to control the workers' access into the facility.\nd. Periodically verify young workers are not working overtime, nights, or in hazardous conditions/roles.\ne. Ensure underage labor assistance/remediation process is designed to provide for the welfare of the individual.\n\nf. Ensure that the three-way agreement required between the student workers (and/or legal guardian), school and supplier include:\n\ni. Student worker’s full name ii. Student worker’s emergency contact information\niii. The name and address of the student worker’s school\niv. The name and address of the reviewee. v. Living conditions (if applicable)\nvi. Wages and benefits\nvii. Costs (if any) for meals and accommodation (shall be no higher than a fair market rate)\nviii. Working hours\nix. Nature of work and place where it shall be performed. x. Signed in three copies.\n\n4. Records are maintained including:\n\na. Due diligence reports on educational partners\nb. Maintain verification of worker age and right-to-work status until at least 12 months or as required by law whichever is longer.\nc. After the worker departs the company.\nd. Learner records are maintained, accurate, complete, and up to date.\ne. Maintenance of student worker/intern or apprentices' records in personnel files (includes agreement if applicable, learning objectives, evaluations, reference to training material, assignment, etc.)\nf. Details on promotion/hiring opportunities after successful apprenticeship, eligibility, recruitment, employment agreement, nature of work, working hours, wages, and benefits.\n\n5. Serious conditions that will result in a severe finding:\n\nUnderage workers are present.\nYoung workers performing inherently hazardous work.\n\n\nElements to Demonstrate Compliance to RBA Code:\n\n1.Policy: Have a detailed, comprehensive documented working hour policy with elements including:\n\na. Standard hours worked, days off, sick leave allowance, holidays, leave/vacation allowance, and paternity/maternity leave, in conformance to local law.\nb. Meal and rest breaks, overtime policy and limits; in conformance to local law and good safety practices. These shall include gender-responsive measures and other accommodations.\nc. Note limits on i. Working hours in the facilities designated standard workweek (e.g. Sunday to Saturday, Monday to Sunday): must not be more than 60 including overtime. ii. Consecutive working days after which a day of rest is granted with no company work or obligations (e.g., training, being on call): must not be more than 6 iii. Overtime.\n\nNOTE: Unless specified otherwise by local legal requirements, this provision does not apply to exempt workers, including those in executive, managerial, or professional positions.\n\n2. Procedures & Practices are in place such that:\n\na. The work hours and time off policy is communicated to workers at the time of hire and in an employee handbook.\nb. There is a process to remain aware of and in compliance with local and national laws and regulations regarding working hours.\nc. You have obtained any necessary permission from authorities/unions on work schedule (e.g., comprehensive work week / work hour schedule)\nd. RBA Code requires that companies comply with local laws or Code, whichever is more stringent. If the company has a valid and current government waiver (e.g., Comprehensive Work Hour System in China, which allows shifting of overtime limits), this waiver is considered “local law.” Regardless of the waiver, the 60 hours/week limit is in place.\ne. Any legal non-conformance is rated a major non-conformance. An exception to this rule is whether weekly working hours are below or equal to 60h/week but above local law for less than 40% of the reviewed working hours.\nf. There is a process to track and analyze hours over time, including identification of capacity constraints, and is taking action to reduce overtime to target level.\ng. You have a work hours management system to ensure that workers do not work overtime in excess of legal limits. Work weeks do not exceed than 60 hours, including overtime, except in Emergency or Unusual Situations.\n\nNOTE: The RBA recognizes truly unpredictable events that may require overtime in excess of RBA limits. These are Emergency or Unusual Situations which cannot be planned for orforeseen. Such situations are uncommon and do not become standard operating procedure. Examples include:\n\ni. Equipment breakdown, power failure or other emergency resulting in prolonged shutdown of a production line.\n\nii. Unforeseen raw material or component shortages or quality issues shut down production. Excessive overtime is then needed in both situations to recoup lost production time and meet customer commitments.\niii. In all of these cases evidence of FEWER hours worked before a period of excessive production due to an Emergency or Unusual Situation is present and documented. The site has a documented plan to recover from the emergency situation and bring working hours back into conformance.\n\nNOTE: the types of situations are NOT Emergency or Unusual Situations include:\n\niv. Holidays, peak season production demands and new product ramps. These are predictable and proper planning can minimize overtime requirements.\nv. Contract change orders that significantly increase order volumes or shorten delivery timelines. This should be negotiated in good faith between the client and the location and should never exceed the capacity of the location at a rate of 60 hours per week or the legal maximum work hour requirement for the location.\n\nh. Workers may refuse overtime without threat of retaliation, penalty, or dismissal.\n\ni. The facility provides meal breaks, rest breaks, rest days, leave periods, holidays, and vacation days per local legal requirements (most countries require workers to be given a 15-to-30-minute break every so many hours, as well as defined meal breaks).\nj. Legal working hours are communicated to workers (worker handbook, notice board, orientation training, and other means).\nk. Workers are not required to work on their designated day off.\n\n3. Controls & Monitoring should include:\n\na. Ensure there is a strong tracking and recording system which will allow for accurate reporting, record keeping allowing for investigation, and visibility to those planning workload to avoid going over limits if not actively limit planning work beyond work hour and workday limits.\nb. Ensure awareness of requirements of compliance with local and national/regional laws and regulations including any approved comprehensive work week / work hour schedule, RBA requirements and any customer requirements regarding working hours, workdays, and overtime\nc. Develop and implement a planning, training, staffing and work assignment strategy to ensure conformance with all requirements.\nd. Train and then refresh train planning and manufacturing staff on limits of working hours and days worked including the limits of any Young Workers and Learners present.\ne. Monitor actual performance and actively adjust and control working hours including overtime and days worked to ensure conformance to policy.\nf. Supplier monitors hours for any workers of on-site supplier / subcontractor / agent to ensure the meet the stricter of local law, RBA Code of Conduct, customer requirements, or company policy.\n\n4. Records are maintained including:\n\na. Accurately determine and record days, time and overtime worked to ensure conformance and the provide accurate due monetary compensation.\nb. Exceptional circumstances shall be recorded at the time of the Emergency or Unusual Situation along with the plan to recover. Not after the event.\nc. Leave records are securely kept, accurate and consistent with medical certificates, actual leave (including maternity/paternity) and holidays.\n\n5. Serious conditions that will result in a severe finding:\n\nNot allowing worker to take time off for illness or maternity when they present a valid medical certificate or recognized notification.\n\n6.

Workers’ exposures to chemical, biological, and physical hazards will be identified, evaluated, and adequately controlled in accordance with the hierarchy of controls, which is maintained through ongoing, systematic monitoring of worker’s health.\nb. Ensure that there is proper budget and staffing allocated to conduct risk assessment, medical evaluations, provide PPE as well as training of individuals and coordination with local authorities as appropriate.\n\n2. Procedures & Practices are in place such that:\n\na. The facility has conducted a risk assessment using established methodology to evaluate the risk of exposure to biological, chemical, and/or physical agents at the facility. This is sometimes referred to as a qualitative exposure assessment to determine if there is a risk of exceeding exposure limits.\nb. The need for exposure monitoring/air sampling is based on the results of the qualitative assessment and should occur if appropriate. Some countries require routine exposure monitoring regardless of the level of exposure.\n\nNOTE: Risk assessment must include exposure to multiple chemicals.\n\nc. Where there is risk that the exposure may be significant, or when required by local regulations, the facility conducts baseline (initial) and routine exposure monitoring/sampling to determine exposure levels to biological, chemical, and/or physical agents at the facility.\n\nd. The facility has implemented controls to reduce or eliminate worker exposure to chemical, biological and physical agents:\n\ni. Engineering controls (e.g. exhaust ventilation, enclosures, etc.) are designed to reduce worke exposure to chemical, biological and physical agents.\nii. Substitution of less hazardous chemicals and processes.\niii. Administrative controls (limiting worker exposure time; job rotation) are designed to reduce worker exposures to chemical, biological and physical agents.\niv. Appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is issued to all workers only when engineering or administrative controls do not reduce exposures to acceptable levels.\n\ne. PPE\n\ni. Minimum PPE requirements for entering or working in any production area with open surface tanks of hazardous chemicals where there is a risk of contact with or exposure to the contents of the tank include respirators appropriate to the level and type of inhalation exposure, safety shoes, long sleeves, chemically resistant gloves, and eye protection.\nii. Workers have been trained to use PPE as intended.\niii. PPE is free to workers.\niv. PPE is properly maintained and/or replaced at appropriate intervals to ensure effectiveness in reducing exposures.\nv. Use of PPE is enforced.\n\nf. Chemicals (including hazardous substances, IFPCs5 ) are adequately and effectively.\n\ni. Categorized\nii. Handled\niii. Stored\niv. Moved within a single facility/ multiple facility.\n\nv. Access is controlled. vi. Potential employee exposure control methods are adequate and effective, such as\n\n1. Segregation\n2. Secondary containment\n3. Ventilation\n4. Fire protection\n5. Appropriate storage cabinets\n\nvii. Proper marking of all chemical, biological, and physical agents to the stricter of regulations, GHS, or customer standards. viii. SDSs are available in local languages for workers or a language that they can understand.\n\nNOTE: SDSs may be in physical form (e.g., paper) and available near to the area where the chemical is present or online. If they are online, workers must be trained and able to easily access the most current SDS.\n\n3. Controls & Monitoring should include:\n\na. Regular evaluation plan to verify the effectiveness of implemented controls and corrective actions if required. The frequency should be at least every 3 years unless a Significant Change requires reevaluation.\nb. The facility carries out risk assessments when new chemicals are introduced into the facility's operations or whenever modifications to the facility’s processes could change worker exposure levels. The facility carries out exposure monitoring/sampling when the risk of exposure may be significant or when the exposure assessment is required by local regulations.\nc. An adequate and effective mitigation process for all significant actual and potential occupational health and safety risks identified, tracking implementation, and resulting adverse impact.\nd. Approval is required for the purchase and use of hazardous chemicals and for all new purchases of hazardous chemicals before use.\ne. Evaluations of chemicals (including hazardous chemicals) of less hazardous or non-hazardous alternatives, including Greenhouse Gas and ozone depletion impact.\nf. Engineering controls are implemented to mitigate worker exposure effectively and adequately to substances containing IFPC List chemicals, which is demonstrated by industrial hygiene records.\n5 IFPC (Industry focus process chemicals) include chemical mixtures that contain any of the following ingredients:\na)1-Bromopropane (CAS 106-94-5)\nb)Benzene (71-43-2)\nc)Dichloromethane (Methylene Chloride) (75-09-2)\nd)Methanol (67-56-1)\ne)n-Hexane (110-54-3)\nf) N-Methyl-Pyrrolidone (NMP) (872-50-4)\ng)Tetrachloroethylene (127-18-4)\nh)Toluene (108-88-3)\ni) Trichloroethylene (79-01-6)\n\ng. IFPCs\n\ni. An adequate and effective process for all hazardous chemicals to track, review, approve for use, and approve all new purchases of IFPCs before use.\nii. An adequate and effective recorded program to control the identified potential hazards to chemical, biological, or physical agents is in place and follows the hierarchy of controls in a documented gated process, demonstrating that each hierarchy level has been fully evaluated and reasons why it could not address the risk fully before proceeding to the next hierarchal level.\niii. A prioritized review and selection process to eliminate, substitute or isolate workers from all IFPCs.\n\nNOTE: Administrative controls or PPE are used as designed controls for substances containing IFPCs only in temporary circumstances or in supplement to engineering controls.\n\nh. Monitoring, testing, alarm, and reporting equipment is available, well-maintained, calibrated, and operational.\n\n4. Records are maintained including:\n\na. Copies of hazardous substances inventory, manifests, and shipping papers are maintained and accurate.\nb. Accurate chemical inventory records are maintained and accurate.\nc.
