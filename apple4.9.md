### Combustible Dust Hazard Management

## Supplier Code of Conduct Requirements

Supplier shall implement a documented program to identify, evaluate, and control the hazards of processes and operations that produce combustible dust.

# Supplier Responsibility Standards

1. Combustible Dust Hazard Identification

1.1 Identification of Potential Hazards

Any Dust/particulate used or created by a Supplier shall be considered a Potential Combustible Dust Hazard until proven otherwise by testing. These processes include but are not limited to:

• A process where a dry or wet dust collector is being used to collect dust   
• Any grinding, sanding, shredding, cutting, milling, routing, or drilling process that generates fine particulates or dust.   
• Any polishing, brushing, or buffing process that creates dust   
• Any other process or manufacturing operation that generates or handles dust or media blasting or other powders.

1.2 Evaluation of Potential Hazards

Supplier shall evaluate all identified Potential Combustible Dust Hazards as follows:

• The dust must be tested to determine whether it is explosive by first testing in a Modified Hartmann Lucite tube with a constant arc energy source of 10 joules — and, if not explosive/hazardous in this test, conducting a subsequent test in a 20-liter vessel according to ASTM E1226 Go/No-Go Screening Test criteria

• If the Dust is determined to be explosible, Supplier shall have the dust further tested in support of the pending dust hazard analysis (risk review) to determine its Explosion Severity Kst (ASTM E1226), Minimum Ignition Energy (ASTM E2019), and Minimum Explosible Concentration (ASTM E1515) values   
• If the sample was not ignitable in the Modified Hartmann Lucite tube, the Minimum Ignition Energy test is not required and the Minimum Ignition Energy shall be reported as greater than 10 joules   
• If the Kst value is greater than 0 bar∙m/sec, the dust shall be deemed a Combustible Dust and those areas of the facility where the Combustible Dust is present, in sufficient quantities to create a deflagration or explosion, shall be deemed to contain a Combustible Dust Hazard

Hence forth the use of the term ‘combustible dust’ means that supplier has carried out necessary testing as described in 1.2 above and has established that combustible dust hazard exists at the facility.

1.3 Combustible Dust Response Team

Supplier shall form a Combustible Dust Response Team (CDRT) and assign a Directly Responsible Individual (DRI) to lead identification, testing, and training at each facility where combustible dust hazard is established. The team shall have the obligation and authority to direct the Supplier’s actions for the management of combustible dust operations, housekeeping and maintenance to ensure the protection of Worker health and safety, the environment and the community.

2. Combustible Dust Program

Supplier shall follow the procedures in its combustible dust management program to mitigate hazards. The program shall include the following elements:

• Analysis of operations and processes related to production of combustible dust, and analysis of hazards arising from such processes and operations. The program shall include a documented risk assessment methodology used to assess and prioritize the hazards known as Dust Hazard Analysis (DHA). • Additional dust testing may be required to identify combustibility parameters for appropriate mitigation measures • System to identify the controls necessary to mitigate these risks • Identification of qualified third parties specializing in combustible dust testing, as well as designing, and installing dust capture from processes

2.1 Dust Hazard Assessment (DHA)

Facilities processing, creating or handling combustible dust, are required to perform a Dust Hazard Analysis (DHA) and risk assessment per industry best practice NFPA 652. Where possible, this review should take place prior to the start of manufacturing. This review shall be based upon the previously mentioned combustibility testing data and all storage, processing and waste management risks encountered in the workplace/facility related to combustible dust producing processes and equipment.

A DHA shall be facilitated by a qualified person or third-party for any confirmed combustible dust. Other participants in the review from related facility departments should include Maintenance, Engineering, Operations and Environment and Health and Safety (EHS).

3. Operational Practices for Combustible Dust

Once the risks are analyzed and qualified in the DHA, appropriate controls shall be implemented to mitigate the hazards to the lowest acceptable risk levels. A list of controls mentioned below should be implement based on the process and the risk levels as applicable. Controls listed are not the only control a facility may need to implement. Additional controls may be required to fully mitigate risks arising from combustible dust operations.

3.1 Electrical Hazard Area Classification (HAC)

Facilities where Combustible Dust is being produced or is otherwise present shall be subject to a Hazardous Area Classification analysis. NFPA 499, GB 12476.1, and GB 12476.2 or equivalent should be followed for guidance in conducting the analysis.

The Hazardous Area Classification analysis shall be performed by qualified persons who have demonstrated competency in the area of conducting these analyses.

3.2 Collection of Combustible Dust

Machines that produce fine particles of combustible material shall be provided with hoods, capture devices, or enclosures that are connected to a dust collection system having suction and capture velocity to collect and transport all the dust produced.

Enclosureless dust collectors are prohibited for collection of metal dust.

For dust collectors equipped with fan/blowers and where metal is used for construction of fan blades or housings, the metal shall be a non-sparking such as bronze, nonmagnetic stainless steel or aluminum.

Dry dust collectors shall not be used for collection of aluminum, magnesium, niobium, tantalum, titanium, zirconium or hafnium dusts.

Transport velocities inside the ductwork shall be sufficient to ensure the transport of both coarse and fine particles and to ensure re-entrainment if, for any reason, the particles fall out before delivery to the collector. For metal dusts, a minimum transport velocity of 23 m/sec is required. For non-metal dusts a minimum transport velocity of 20 m/sec is required.

3.3 Combustible Dust Control via Housekeeping

A housekeeping plan shall be developed and maintained for any areas presenting a Combustible Dust hazard. The plan shall include appropriate methods and processes for performing the cleaning.

Regular cleaning frequencies shall be established for walls, floors, and horizontal surfaces, such as equipment, ducts, pipes, hoods, ledges, beams, and above suspended ceilings and other concealed surfaces, to minimize accumulations of dust that present a Combustible Dust hazard within the facility.

In areas where metal dust is being produced, or otherwise handled, dust shall not be allowed to accumulate to a level that obscures the color of the surface beneath it.

Surfaces shall be cleaned in a manner that minimizes the generation of dust clouds. Vigorous sweeping, brushing, or blowing dust with compressed air produces dust clouds and shall not be permitted.

3.4 Control of ignition sources

Facilities with combustible dust hazards must have robust controls to eliminate ignition sources. Such facilities should have:

• Hot work permit program   
• A no-smoking policy   
• Permanently installed process equipment including ventilation and dust collection systems. All building structural steel shall be grounded and bonded to prevent static electricity build up. Grounding and bonding should be periodically checked to ensure continuity.   
• All machinery shall be installed and maintained in a manner that minimizes the possibility of friction sparks. Hot surfaces should be maintained below the Minimum Ignition Temperature (MIT) of a dust layer ASTM E2021, of combustible dust.

3.5 Process improvements

Facilities can implement, where applicable and technically feasible, processes such as:

• Dust capture water curtains • Wet polishing/machining • Extraction ventilation

3.6 Performance Based Option

As an alternative, where and when necessary, a qualified person(s) may develop performance-based design provisions with regards to management of Combustible Dust fire and explosion hazards, in lieu of the prescriptive requirements outlined in this standard.

• The performance-based design must demonstrate that the approach provides at least an equivalent measure of safety with regard to prescriptive requirements • The performance-based design should be documented with all calculations, references, assumptions, and sources from which material characteristics and other data have been obtained or on which the designer has relied for some material aspect of the design

4. Training and Communication

Many significant industrial dust explosions have been attributed to a lack of hazard awareness for the persons handling combustible dust. Therefore, it is critical that the Supplier shall train its workers, contractors, or any other affected individuals. This should include training on:

• Combustible dust hazard awareness training.   
• Standard operating procedures and consequences of deviation from processes and operations within their work area.   
• New material or manufacturing process where introduced or changed.   
• Emergency response associated with processing of combustible dust.

Additional materials and guidance are available by contacting SupplierCare@apple.com

• Animals in the production of leather, including at the farm, in transport, or at any other point in the Supply Chain shall not be treated inhumanely

2. Risk Identification

Suppliers shall identify the High Risks in their Supply Chains by first understanding the Processors of Relevant Minerals or Relevant Materials in their Supply Chains. For Relevant Materials, High Risks shall be identified back to the Source or Origin level. As new Relevant Minerals or Relevant Materials are included in this Standard, Apple will provide timelines for a phase-in period in order for Suppliers to implement corresponding risk identification requirements. Types of High Risks are:

• Red Flag Risks — at the mining, farm, transport, trading, or Processor level of the Supply Chain: - Conflict risks: Direct or indirect finance or benefit to armed groups that are perpetrators of serious human rights abuses consistent with the OECD Guidance, including in the DRC or an adjoining country OECD Annex II and human rights risks: Forced labor, human trafficking, the worst forms of child labor, illegal taxation, and widespread gross human rights abuses, including sexual violence, as well as other human rights violations. Many of the foregoing are also identified in OECD Annex II

- Embargoed countries or High Risk Entities risks: Sourcing from embargoed countries (as described in the High Risk Regions list defined in this Standard) or from High Risk Entities

• Other High Risks – at the mining, farm, transport, trading, or Processor level of the Supply Chain:

- Health and safety violations, including both community and workers   
- Environmental impacts, including water abstraction and consumption, waste, pollution and tailings management, deforestation such as illegal logging, and encroachment on protected areas   
- Animal welfare impacts, such as the inhumane treatment of animals.   
Indigenous peoples’ and affected communities’ rights impacts, including lack of free, prior, and informed consent, potential resettlement and encroachment on cultural heritage sites   
- Retaliatory threats, intimidation, or attacks against human rights and environmental defenders

These and any other applicable risks may be identified through activities of section 2.1 and 2.2.

2.1 Supply Chain Mapping

Suppliers shall map their Supply Chains for Relevant Minerals and Relevant Materials. This mapping shall occur at least annually, or additionally as requested by Apple, and include:

• Identification and location information with respect to all of a Supplier’s subcontractors and sub-suppliers associated with Relevant Minerals and Relevant Materials • Identification of the Processors of Relevant Minerals and Relevant Materials

• The country of origin of all Relevant Minerals and Relevant Materials • Suppliers shall communicate the following Supply Chain mapping requirements to their Supply Chains and ensure the following requirements are met by Processors, including their traders (if any) and sub-suppliers back to the Source or Origin in their Supply Chains:

<table><tr><td>LEVEL OF SUPPLY CHAIN</td><td>REQUIRED ACTIONS FOR MAPPING SUPPLY CHAIN</td></tr><tr><td>Processor (for it and its traders)</td><td>·Map Supply Chain of Relevant Minerals and Relevant Materials to the Source or Origin,for example: to the Mining Company or the original source of primary ore at the mining level, to the original source of commodity at the farm level, or to the secondary material source level (such as collection points) through traders and intermediaries</td></tr><tr><td>Source or Origin</td><td>Map Supply Chain of Relevant Minerals and Relevant Materials to the Source or Origin,for example: to the farm for Bio-material, or collection points for recycled material,or to the specific mines for primary ore including,where applicable,artisanal mining responsible sourcing systems (e.g., point of collection approved via a responsible sourcing initiative,standard,or verification or audit program)</td></tr></table>

See Section 5.1 of this Standard for reporting requirements on required actions above.

2.2 Risk Mapping

Suppliers shall map the particular risks in their Supply Chains annually, regardless of whether such risks are at the level of processing, trading and transporting, or mining, farming or production of Relevant Minerals or Relevant Materials. Suppliers shall use reasonable efforts to track whether these specific risks are associated with Goods provided to Apple.

• Suppliers are expected to proactively and regularly consult current country risk information sources to determine whether Relevant Minerals originate from or are transported through High Risk Regions, and whether Relevant Materials originate from High Risk Regions or from a Source or Origin of High Risk   
• Suppliers shall require, to the extent practicable, that Processors and Mining Companies complete approved risk assessments to gather information on applicable risks   
Suppliers shall, to the extent reasonably available, use multiple sources of information to determine or confirm the existence of High Risks. Sources of information may include general risk notifications and reports from governments, local or international non-governmental organizations, civil society groups, research organizations, or other Third Party organizations.

Suppliers shall communicate the following Supply Chain mapping requirements to their Supply Chains and ensure the following requirements are met by Processors and Source or Origin (such as Mining Companies) in their Supply Chains:

<table><tr><td>LEVEL OF SUPPLY CHAIN</td><td>REQUIRED RISK MAPPING ACTIONS</td></tr><tr><td>Processor (for it and its traders)</td><td>·Determine if countries of origin or transport include High Risk Regions Determine if the Source or Origin of Relevant Minerals or Relevant Materials is a High Risk Entity Complete Approved Risk Assessments of all owned</td></tr><tr><td>Source or Origin</td><td>trading relationships Review and investigate identified and prioritized risks received from Apple and any other sources,including any alleged or confirmed High Risks,and request clarification as needed Complete Approved Risk Assessments of its mining</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>practices at the mining site level and owned and operated facilities Review and investigate applicable risks identified by Apple and alleged or confirmed High Risks relating to its region(s) of operations,mining,and mining relationships (or farms for Bio-materials or collection points for recycled materials)</td></tr></table>

Suppliers shall also gather additional information in connection with risk mapping as may be requested by Apple. Further, Mining Companies shall also support the principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative https://eiti.org/ document/expectations-for-eiti-supporting-companies.

3. Risk Prevention, Mitigation, and Resolution

As risk prevention, mitigation, and resolution systems are presently developing and maturing, Apple will provide timelines for a phase-in period in order for Suppliers to prioritize efforts to prevent, mitigate, and influence the resolution of High Risks on an ongoing basis.

3.1 Addressing Identified Risks

If a Supplier or Apple discovers alleged or actual risks associated with its Supply Chain, Supplier shall work with Apple to respond to the applicable risks by (to the extent not prohibited by applicable law):

• Requiring corresponding Supply Chain actors, including Processors, to address identified High Risks

• Utilizing grievance channels of recognized Third Party organizations to report risks and request that appropriate action be taken to address identified High Risks (see section 6.3 of this Standard)

Suppliers shall communicate the following prevention and mitigation requirements to their Supply Chains to ensure the following requirements are met by Processors and Mining Companies in their Supply Chains:

<table><tr><td>LEVEL OF SUPPLY CHAIN</td><td>REQUIRED ACTIONS TO PREVENT AND MITIGATE APPLICABLERISKS</td></tr><tr><td>Processor (for it and its traders)</td><td>·Resolve reporting gaps in Approved Risk Assessments ·Directly or indirectly request applicable Supply Chain actors take prevention,mitigation,and resolution actions</td></tr><tr><td>Source or Origin</td><td>·Resolve reporting gaps in Approved Risk Assessments ·Prevent or resolve High Risks pertaining to the Mining Company&#x27;s or Source or Origin business; where direct action cannot be taken,an indirect or collective approach may be considered appropriate</td></tr></table>

3.2 Tracking and Reporting on Action taken to Address Identified Risks

As requested by Apple, Suppliers shall apply appropriate and reasonable leverage to ensure identified risks and their resolutions are tracked and publicly reported or, as agreed to with Apple, otherwise communicated and addressed.

3.3 Removal of Non-Participating Supply Chain Actors

Suppliers shall terminate relationships with Supply Chain actors that are:

• Unwilling to engage in necessary Supply Chain and risk mapping, resolutions of High Risks, and verifications or audits   
• Associated with Red Flag Risks but have not taken appropriate timely action to mitigate the corresponding risk

To the extent requested, Suppliers shall work with Apple in connection with such terminations.

Suppliers shall communicate the following requirements to their Supply Chains to ensure these requirements are met by Processors, Mining Companies, and other Source or Origin with respect to potential terminations of Supply Chain actors:

<table><tr><td>LEVEL OF SUPPLY CHAIN</td><td>REQUIRED ACTIONS ON REMOVALS</td></tr><tr><td>Processor (for it and its traders)</td><td>·Notify Processors,traders and mines of potential removal of those who have demonstrated they are unwilling to conduct risk identification,mitigation,and verification or audit of overall due diligence Remove such actors if action is not taken within a designated timeframe</td></tr><tr><td>Source or Origin</td><td>Notify large scale mining (LSM) and Smal Scale mining (ASM/SSM) and/or farm enterprises of potential removal of those that have demonstrated they are unwilling to conduct risk identification, mitigation,and verification or audit of overall due diligence Remove such actors if action is not taken within a designated timeframe</td></tr></table>

4. Third-Party Verifications or Audits of Supply Chain Due Diligence

Suppliers shall only use or source Relevant Minerals from Supply Chain actors that have demonstrated progress towards or completion of responsible sourcing verifications or audits by recognized Third Party organizations (see Section 6.1 of this Standard). For Relevant Materials, Suppliers seeking further information on recognized Third-Party organizations and applicable standards should contact Apple, including recycled and Bio-materials.
